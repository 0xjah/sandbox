# tmp/

Ephemeral storage for runtime artifacts such as captures and temporary files.

Contents
- `capture.pcap` — example packet capture included in the repo for testing.

Notes
- This directory is intended to be transient. Do not rely on it for persistent storage.
- Add `tmp/` to your `.gitignore` if you create large or sensitive files here.
